# CuteWords
A simple mod that automatically replaces parts of player chat when matching replacement rules defined in the config file.

There are two config files: 'cuteWords.toml' matches case, while 'cuteWordsCaseInsensitive.toml' does not.

Wildcards `*` and `?` are supported. If you don't want to use wildcards, you can use the escape character `\`.

Supports `/reload` for hot-reloading.
